{"name":"nnForge","tagline":"Convolutional and fully-connected neural networks C++ library","body":"What is nnForge?\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nnnForge is a library for training convolutional and fully-connected neural networks. It includes CPU and GPU (CUDA) backends.\r\n\r\nThe library implements Stochastic Diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm, well described in:\r\n* Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio and P. Haffner: Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition, _Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278-2324, November 1998_\r\n* Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, G. Orr and K. Muller: Efficient BackProp, in Orr, G. and Muller K. (Eds), _Neural Networks: Tricks of the trade, Springer, 1998_\r\n\r\nYou will find these papers at [Yann LeCun site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/index.html).\r\n\r\nIt also has \"dropout\" regularization implemented:\r\n* Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors, Geoffery Hinton, Nitish Srivastava, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov, [arXiv, 2012](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0580.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe package contains not only nnForge library but also examples - applications using the library.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nnnForge is an open-source software distributed under the [Apache License v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGet [archive](https://github.com/milakov/nnForge/tarball/master) with the latest version v1.0.2.
